This addon aims to make it easier for a player to check their gear against
a pre-made "Best In Slot" or "BiS" list for their current character, given
their class and spec.

For each slot the BiS item is displayed, along with from where that item can
be obtined.

The command to display this list is: **/bis**

This is a project just recently started, there are many things that can be
done to improve the addon, but, I think this may be of use to others too
in its current form.
