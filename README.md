As a player of **World of Warcraft**, one that plays many alts, I often find
myself going on the browser and check newly obtained gear against *Best in
Slot* listings on sites, or to see what stat priority is for the current spec.

This addon aims to make it easier for a player to check their gear against a
pre-made "Best In Slot" or "BiS" list for their current character, given their
class and spec, without the need to leave the game. For each slot the BiS item
is displayed, along with from where that item can be obtined.

The command to display this list is: **/bis**

This is a project just recently started, there are many things that can be
done to improve the addon, but, I think this may be of use to others too
in its current form.

Some of the things that may happen in the future:
* A graphical display to show BiS equipment set with color coded status.
* More information about current player spec, such as stat priority.
* Put some indicator of in-game character frame for bis info.
