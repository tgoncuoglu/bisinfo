This addon is aiming to make it easier for a player to check their gear
against a pre-made "Best In Slot" or "BiS" list for their current character.

For each slot the BiS item is displayed, along with from where that addon can
be obtined.

The command to display the list is: **/bis**

This is a project just recently started, and frankly for just to make life
easier for myself, but, I think this may be of use to other too.
